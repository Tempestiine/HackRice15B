How to Put it Online for Anyone (Deploying) 🌐
When you want to share your progress with your team or submit the final project, you'll use GitHub Pages. It's a free service from GitHub that hosts websites directly from your repository.

Go to your project's GitHub repository on the GitHub website.

Click on the Settings tab.

On the left-side menu, click on Pages.

Under "Branch," select your main branch (it's usually called main or master).

Click Save.

GitHub will then build your site and give you a public URL, like your-username.github.io/your-repository-name. It can take a minute or two to go live. Anyone with this link can view your website!
